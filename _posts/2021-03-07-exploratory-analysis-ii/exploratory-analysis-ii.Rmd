1.  Load the R package we will use.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)  #install before using 
```


2. Quiz questions

- Replace all the ???s. These are answers on your moodle quiz.  
* Run all the individual code chunks to make sure the answers in this file correspond with your quiz answers
* After you check all your code chunks run then you can knit it.  It won't knit until the ??? are replaced


* The quiz assumes that you have watched the videos, downloaded (to your examples folder) and worked through the exercises in [exercises_slides-50-61.Rmd](https://stanny.moodle.school/mod/assign/view.php?id=3117)


3. Pick one of your plots to save as your preview plot.  Use the `ggsave` command at the end of the chunk of the plot that you want to preview.  


# Question: modify slide 51

- Create a plot with the `mpg` dataset
- add points with `geom_point`
    - assign the variable `displ` to the x-axis
    - assign the variable `hwy` to the y-axis
- add `facet_wrap` to split the data into panels based on the `manufacturer`


```{r}
ggplot(data = ???) + 
   ???(aes(x = ???, y = ???)) +
   ???(facets = vars(???))
```


****


# Question: modify facet-ex-2

- Create a plot with the `mpg` dataset
- add bars with with `geom_bar`
    - assign the variable `manufacturer` to the y-axis
- add `facet_grid` to split the data into panels based on the `class`
    * let scales vary across columns
    * let space taken up by panels vary by columns


```{r}
ggplot(???) + 
  ???(aes(y = ???)) + 
  ???(vars(???), scales = "???", space = "???")

# Question: spend_time

To help you complete this question use:

- the **patchwork slides** and
- the vignette: https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/patchwork.html

Download the file `spend_time.csv` from moodle into directory for this post.  Or read it in directly:  

`read_csv("https://estanny.com/static/week8/spend_time.csv")`


- `spend_time` contains 10 years of data on how many hours Americans spend each day on 5 activities

- read it into  `spend_time`

```{r}
spend_time  <- read_csv("???")
```

****

Start with `spend_time`

- extract observations for **SEE QUIZ**
- THEN create a plot with that data
- ADD a barchart with with `geom_col`
    - assign `activity` to the x-axis
    - assign `avg_hours` to the y-axis
    - assign `activity` to fill
- ADD `scale_y_continuous` with breaks every hour from 0 to 6 hours 
- ADD `labs` to
    - set `subtitle` to **SEE QUIZ**
    - set `x` and `y` to NULL so they won't be labeled 
- assign the output to `p1` 
- display `p1`
 

```{r}
p1  <- spend_time %>% filter(year == "???")  %>% 
ggplot() + 
  ???(???(x = ???, y = ???, ??? = activity)) +
  ???(breaks = seq(0, 6, by = 1)) +
  labs(subtitle = "???", x = NULL, y = NULL)

p1 
```

****

Start with `spend_time`

- THEN create a plot with it
- ADD a barchart with with `geom_col`
    - assign `year` to the x-axis
    - assign `avg_hours` to the y-axis
    - assign `activity` to fill
- ADD `labs` to 
    - set subtitle to "Avg hours per day: 2010-2019"    
    - set x and y to NULL so they won't be labeled 
- assign the output to `p2` 
- display `p2`



```{r}
p2  <- ???  %>% 
ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = year, y = avg_hours, fill = activity)) +
  ???(subtitle  = "Avg hours per day: 2010-2019", x = NULL, y = NULL) 

p2

```

****

Use patchwork to display  `p1` on top of `p2`

- assign the output to `p_all`
- display `p_all`

```{r}
p_all  <-  ??? / ??? 

???

```

****

Start with `p_all` 

- AND set `legend.position` to 'none' to get rid of the legend
- assign the output to `p_all_no_legend`
- display `p_all_no_legend`


```{r}
p_all_no_legend  <- p_all & theme(??? = 'none')
p_all_no_legend
```

****

Start with `p_all_no_legend` 

- see how annotate the composition here: https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/plot_annotation.html
- ADD `plot_annotation` set
    - `title` to "How much time Americans spent on selected activities"
    - `caption` to "Source: American Time of Use Survey, https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?tu"


```{r}
p_all_no_legend  +
 ???(??? = "How much time Americans spent on selected activities", 
                  ??? = "Source: American Time of Use Survey, https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?tu")

```


# Question: Patchwork 2

use `spend_time` from last question **patchwork slides** 

Start with `spend_time`

- extract observations for **SEE QUIZ**
- THEN create a plot with that data
- ADD points with `geom_point` 
    - assign `year` to the x-axis
    - assign `avg_hours` to the y-axis
- ADD line with `geom_smooth`     
    - assign `year` to the x-axis
    - assign `avg_hours` to the y-axis
- ADD breaks on for every year on x axis with with `scale_x_continuous`     
- ADD `labs` to
    - set `subtitle` to **SEE QUIZ**
    - set `x` and `y` to NULL so x and y axes won't be labeled 
- assign the output to `p4` 
- display `p4`

```{r}
p4  <- 
spend_time %>% ???(activity == "???")  %>% 
ggplot() + 
  ???(aes(x = year, y = avg_hours)) ???
  ???(aes(??? = year, ??? = avg_hours)) +
  ???(breaks = seq(2010, 2019, by = 1)) +
  ???(subtitle = "???", x = NULL, y = NULL) 

p4
```

***

Start with `p4`

- ADD `coord_cartesian` to change range on y axis to 0 to 6
- assign the output to `p5` 
- display `p5`
 

```{r}
p5 ???  p4 + ???(ylim = c(0, 6))
p5
```

***

Start with `spend_time`

-  create a plot with that data
- ADD points with `geom_point` 
    - assign `year` to the x-axis
    - assign `avg_hours` to the y-axis
    - assign `activity` to color
    - assign `activity` to group
- ADD line with `geom_smooth`     
    - assign `year` to the x-axis
    - assign `avg_hours` to the y-axis
    - assign `activity` to color
    - assign `activity` to group
- ADD breaks on for every year on x axis with with `scale_x_continuous` 
- ADD `coord_cartesian` to change range on y axis to 0 to 6    
- ADD `labs` to
    - set `x` and `y` to NULL so they won't be labeled 
- assign the output to `p6` 
- display `p6`

```{r}
p6   <- 
 spend_time  %>% 
ggplot() + 
  ???(aes(x = year, y = avg_hours, color = activity, ??? = activity)) +
  ???(aes(x = year, y = avg_hours, color = activity, group = activity)) +
  ???(breaks = seq(2010, 2019, by = 1)) +
  ???(ylim = c(0, 6)) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) 

p6

```

****

Use patchwork to display  `p4` and `p5` on top of `p6`


```{r}
??? p4 | p5 ??? / p6 
```
