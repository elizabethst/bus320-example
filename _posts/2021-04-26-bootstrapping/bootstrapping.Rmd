```{r, include=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code block/chunk

Load the R package we will use.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive) #install before loading
library(infer) #install before loading
library(fivethirtyeight) #install before loading
```


- Replace all the instances of ???. These are answers on your moodle quiz.  

* Run all the individual code chunks to make sure the answers in this file correspond with your quiz answers

* After you check all your code chunks run then you can knit it.  It won't knit until the ??? are replaced

* Save a plot to be your preview plot

- Look at the variable definitions in [`congress_age`](https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/reference/congress_age.html)

**What is the average age of members that have served in congress?**

* Set random seed generator to 123

* Take a sample of 100 from the dataset `congress_age` and assign it to `congress_age_100`


```{r}
set.seed(???)

??? <- ???  %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size=???)
```

* congress_age is the population and ??? is the sample

* ??? is number of observations in the the population and ??? is the number of observations in your sample


**Construct the confidence interval**

**1. Use `specify` to indicate the variable from congress_age_100 that you are interested in** 

```{r}
congress_age_100  %>% 
  ???(response = ???)
```

****

**2. `generate` 1000 replicates of your sample of 100**

```{r}
congress_age_100  %>% 
  specify(response = age)  %>% 
  ???(reps = 1000, type= "bootstrap")
```

The output has ??? rows

****

**3. `calculate` the mean for each replicate** 

- Assign to `bootstrap_distribution_mean_age`

- Display `bootstrap_distribution_mean_age`

```{r}
bootstrap_distribution_mean_age  <- congress_age_100  %>% 
  specify(response = age)  %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap")  %>% 
  ???(stat = "???")

bootstrap_distribution_mean_age
```

- The bootstrap_distribution_mean_age has ??? means

****

**4. `visualize` the bootstrap distribution**


```{r}
???(???) 
```


**Calculate the 95% confidence interval using the percentile method**

- Assign the output to `congress_ci_percentile` 

- Display `congress_ci_percentile` 

```{r}
congress_ci_percentile  <- bootstrap_distribution_mean_age %>% 
  get_confidence_???(type = "???", level = ???)

congress_ci_percentile
```


- **Calculate the observed point estimate of the mean and assign it to `obs_mean_age`**

- Display `obs_mean_age`,

```{r}
obs_mean_age  <-  ???  %>% 
  specify(response = ???)  %>% 
  calculate(stat = "???")  %>% 
  pull()

obs_mean_age
```

- Shade the confidence interval

- Add a line at the observed mean, `obs_mean_age`,  to your visualization and color it "hotpink"

```{r}
visualize(bootstrap_distribution_mean_age) +
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = ???) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = ???, color = "hotpink", size = 1 )
```

- Calculate the population mean to see if it is in the 95% confidence interval

- Assign the output to `pop_mean_age`

- Display `pop_mean_age`

```{r}
pop_mean_age  <- ???  %>% 
  summarize(pop_mean= mean(age))  %>% pull()

pop_mean_age
```

- Add a line to the visualization at the, population mean, `pop_mean_age`, to the plot color it "purple"

```{r}
visualize(bootstrap_distribution_mean_age) +
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = congress_ci_percentile) + 
   geom_vline(xintercept = ???, color = "hotpink", size = 1) +
   geom_vline(xintercept = ??? , color = "purple", size = 3)

```

- Is population mean the 95% confidence interval constructed using the bootstrap distribution? ???

- Change set.seed(123) to set.seed(4346).  Rerun all the code.

    - When you change the seed is the population mean in the 95% confidence interval constructed using the bootstrap distribution? ???
    - If you construct 100 95% confidence intervals approximately how many do you expect will contain the population mean? ???
