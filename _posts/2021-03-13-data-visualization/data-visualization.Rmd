```{r, include=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code block/chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  eval = FALSE,
  echo = TRUE, 
  message=FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  fig.width = 16/2, 
  fig.height = 9/2
  )

library(tidyverse)
```


1.  Load the R package we will use.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate) #install before using for the first time
library(ggforce) #install  before using for the first time
library(hrbrthemes)
theme_set(theme_ipsum()) # set all plot themes 
```


2. Quiz questions

- Replace all the ???s. These are answers on your moodle quiz.  
* Run all the individual code chunks to make sure the answers in this file correspond with your quiz answers
* After you check all your code chunks run then you can knit it.  It won't knit until the ??? are replaced


* The quiz assumes that you have watched the videos, downloaded (to your examples folder) and worked through the exercises in [exercises_slides-50-61.Rmd](https://stanny.moodle.school/mod/assign/view.php?id=3117)


3. Pick one of your plots to save as your preview plot.  Use the `ggsave` command at the end of the chunk of the plot that you want to preview.  



Question
========

To help you complete this question use: the **animate slides** 

- `spend_time` contains 10 years of data on the average number of hours  Americans spend each day on 5 activities

- read  into `spend_time.csv` R and assign to  `spend_time`

`read_csv("https://estanny.com/static/week7/drug_cos.csv")`

- read it into  `spend_time`

```{r}
spend_time  <- read_csv("???")
```


***

Start with `spend_time`
- THEN extract observations for **SEE QUIZ**
- THEN create a plot with that data
- ADD line with `geom_line` 
    - assign `year` to the x-axis
    - assign `avg_hours` to the y-axis
- ADD breaks for every year on x axis with with `scale_x_continuous`  
- ADD `labs` 
    - set `title` to **SEE QUIZ**
    - set `x` and `y` to NULL so x and y axes won't be labeled 
- ADD `transition_reveal` to animate along `year`


```{r}

???  %>% 
???(activity ??? '???') %>% 
ggplot() +
  ???(???(x = year, y = ??? )) +
  ???(??? = seq(2010, 2019, by = 1)) +
  ???(title = "???" , x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  ???(along = ??? ) 

```

# Question

To help you complete this question use: the **animate slides** 

- `spend_time` should be in your environment from the last question


Start with `spend_time`

- THEN create a plot with that data
- ADD points with `geom_point` 
    - assign `year` to the x-axis
    - assign `avg_hours` to the y-axis
    - assign `activity` to color
    - assign `activity` to group
- ADD breaks for every year on x axis with `scale_x_continuous`  
- ADD `labs` 
    - set `title` to **'Activity: {closest_state}'** so the activity will be displayed as the state of the animation changes
    - set subtitle to **'Avg hours spent per day'**
- ADD a function so the legend for color is not displayed 
- ADD `transition_states` to animate across `activity` 



```{r}
??? %>%  
???() + 
 ???(aes(??? = year, ??? = avg_hours, color = ???, group = ???)) +
 ???(breaks = seq(2010, 2019, by =1)) +
labs(??? = 'Activity: {closest_state}', ??? = 'Avg hours spent per day') ???
theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
???(states =??? ) 

```

# Question - Modify slide 82

- Create a plot with the  `spend_time` data
    - assign `year` to the x-axis
    - assign `avg_hours` to the y-axis
    - assign `activity` to color
- ADD points with `geom_point` 
- ADD `geom_mark_ellipse` 
    + filter on activity == "leisure/sports"
    + description is "Americans spend the most time on leisure/sport"


```{r}
ggplot(???, aes(x = ???, y = ??? , ??? = activity)) +
???() +
???(aes(??? = activity == "leisure/sports",
 ???= "Americans spend on average more time each day on leisure/sports than the other activities"))
```
