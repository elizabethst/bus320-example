# Do not edit this code block/chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(

  echo = TRUE,

  )

```


1.  Load the R package we will use.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(echarts4r)
library(ggforce) #install  before using for the first time
library(tidyquant)  #install  before using for the first time
library(hrbrthemes)
theme_set(theme_ipsum()) # set all of the plot themes 
```


2. Quiz questions

- Replace all the instances of 'SEE QUIZ'.  These are inputs from your moodle quiz.  
- Replace all the instances of '???'. These are answers on your moodle quiz.  
* Run all the individual code chunks to make sure the answers in this file correspond with your quiz answers
* After you check all your code chunks run then you can knit it.  It won't knit until the ??? are replaced


* The quiz assumes that you have watched the videos, downloaded (to your examples folder) and worked through the exercises in [exercises_slides-73-108.Rmd](https://estanny.com/static/week9/exercises-73-108.Rmd).  Knitted file is [here](https://estanny.com/static/week9/exercises-73-108.Rmd).




# Question: e_charts-1 

Create a bar chart that shows the average hours Americans spend on five activities by year.  Use the `timeline` argument to create an  animation that will animate through the years. 


- `spend_time` contains 10 years of data on how many hours Americans spend each day on 5 activities

- read it into  `spend_time`

```{r}
spend_time  <- read_csv("https://estanny.com/static/week8/spend_time.csv")
```


**e_charts-1**

Start with `spend_time`

- THEN group_by `year`
- THEN create an  e_chart that assigns `activity` to the x-axis and will show activity by `year` (the variable that you grouped the data on)
- THEN use `e_timeline_opts` to set autoPlay to TRUE
- THEN use `e_bar` to represent the variable `avg_hours` with a bar chart
- THEN use `e_title` to set the main title to 'Average hours Americans spend per day on each activity' 
- THEN remove the legend with `e_legend`


```{r}
???  %>% 
  group_by(???)  %>% 
  e_charts(x =??? , timeline = ???) ???
  ???(autoPlay = TRUE)  %>% 
  e_bar(serie = ???)  %>% 
  ???(text ='Average hours Americans spend per day on each activity')  %>% 
  e_legend(show = ??? )  
```


****

# Question: echarts-2

Create a line chart for the activities that American spend time on.  

Start with `spend_time`

- THEN use `mutate` to convert `year` from an number  to a string  (year-month-day) using `mutate`
  + first convert `year` to a string "201X-12-31" using the function `paste`  
    + `paste` will paste each year to 12 and 31 (separated by -) THEN
- THEN use `mutate` to convert year from a character object to a date object using the `ymd` function from the [`lubridate`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org) package (part of the tidyverse, but not automatically loaded). `ymd` converts dates stored as characters to date objects. 
+ THEN `group_by` the variable `activity` (to get a line for each activity)
+ THEN initiate an `e_charts` object with `year` on the x-axis
- THEN use `e_line` to  add a line to the variable `avg_hours` 
- THEN add a tooltip with `e_tooltip` 
- THEN use `e_title` to set the main title to 'Average hours Americans spend per day on each activity' 
- THEN use `e_legend(top = 40)` to move the legend down (from the top) 


```{r}
???  %>%
  mutate(year = paste(year, "12","31", sep = "-"))  %>% 
  ???(year = lubridate::ymd(year))  %>% 
  ???(???)  %>%
  ???(x  = year)  %>% 
  e_line(serie = ???)  %>% 
  ???()  %>% 
  ???(text = 'Average hours Americans spend per day on each activity')  %>% 
  e_legend(top = 40) 
```


# Question - modify slide 82

- Create a plot with the  `spend_time` data
    - assign `year` to the x-axis
    - assign `avg_hours` to the y-axis
    - assign `activity` to color
- ADD points with `geom_point` 
- ADD `geom_mark_ellipse` 
    + filter on activity == "leisure/sports"
    + description is "Americans spend the most time on leisure/sport"


```{r}
ggplot(???, aes(x = ???, y = ??? , ??? = activity)) +
???() +
???(aes(??? = activity == "leisure/sports",
 ???= "Americans spend on average more time each day on leisure/sports than the other activities"))
```


# Question: tidyquant


**Modify the tidyquant example in the video**

Retrieve stock price for SEE QUIZ, ticker:  **SEE QUIZ**, using `tq_get`
  
  - from **2019-08-01** to  **2020-07-28**
  - assign output to `df`

```{r}
df  <- ???("???", get = "stock.prices", 
          ??? = "2019-08-01", ??? = "2020-07-28" )
```


Create a plot with the  `df` data

- assign `date` to the x-axis
- assign `close` to the y-axis

- ADD a line with  with `geom_line` 
- ADD  `geom_mark_ellipse` 
    + filter on a date to mark.  Pick a date after looking at the line plot. Include the date in your Rmd code chunk. 
    + include a description of something that happened on that date from the pandemic timeline.  Include the description in your Rmd code chunk
    + fill the ellipse yellow
- ADD  `geom_mark_ellipse` 
    + filter on the date that had the  minimum `close` price. Include the date in your Rmd code chunk. 
    + include a description of something that happened on that date from the pandemic timeline.  Include the description in your Rmd code chunk
    + color the ellipse red
- ADD `labs` 
    - set the `title` to **SEE QUIZ** 
    - set x to NULL
    - set y to "Closing price per share" 
    - set caption to "Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States"


```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = ???, y = ???)) +
  ???() +
  ???(aes(
    filter = date == "PICK A DATE",
    description = "REPLACE WITH A DESCRIPTION"
  ), ???= "yellow") +
  geom_mark_ellipse(aes(
   ???  = date == "PICK A DATE",
    description = "REPLACE WITH A DESCRIPTION"
  ), ??? = "red", ) +
  labs(
    title = "???",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Closing price per share",
    ??? = "Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States"
  )
```


Save the previous plot to preview.png and add to the yaml chunk at the top

```{r}
ggsave(filename = "preview.png", 
       path = here::here("_posts", "2021-03-13-data-visualization"))
```
