- Replace all the instances of ???. These are answers on your moodle quiz.  

* Run all the individual code chunks to make sure the answers in this file correspond with your quiz answers

* After you check all your code chunks run then you can knit it.  It won't knit until the ??? are replaced

* Save a plot to be your preview plot

# Question: t-test


* The data this quiz is a subset of [`HR`](https://modeloriented.github.io/DALEX/reference/HR.html)
    * Look at the variable definitions
    * Note that the variables evaluation and salary have been recoded to be represented as words instead of numbers

* Set random seed generator to 123

```
set.seed(???)
```

**SEE QUIZ** is the name of your data subset

- Read it into and assign to `hr`

  - Note: col_types = "fddfff" defines the column types factor-double-double-factor-factor-factor

```{r}
hr  <- read_csv("https://estanny.com/static/week13/data/???", 
                col_types = "fddfff") 
```

### Q: Is the mean number of hours worked per week 48?

```

****

**`hypothesize` that the average hours worked is 48**

```{r}
???  %>% 
  specify(response = hours)  %>% 
  ???(null = "point", mu = ???)

  visualize() +
  ???(obs_stat = ???, direction = "two-sided")
```

***

If the p-value < 0.05? ??? (yes/no)

Does your analysis support the null hypothesis that the true mean number of hours worked was 48? ??? (yes/no)

# Question: 2 sample t-test


**SEE QUIZ** is the name of your data subset

### Q: Is the average number of hours worked the same for both genders?


**use `skim` to summarize the data in `hr_2` by `gender`**

```{r}
hr_2 %>% 
  group_by(???)  %>% 
  ???()
```

- Males worked an average of ??? hours per week

***


**Use `geom_boxplot` to plot distributions of hours worked by gender**

  ???()
```

***

**`specify` the variables of interest are `hours` and `gender`**

```{r}
hr_2 %>% 
  ???(response = ???, explanatory = gender)
```

****

**`hypothesize` that the number of hours worked and gender are independent**

```{r}
???  %>% 
  specify(response = hours, explanatory = gender)  %>% 
  ???(null = "???")
```
***


**`generate` 1000 replicates representing the null hypothesis**

```{r}
hr_2 %>% 
  specify(response = hours, explanatory = gender)  %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence")  %>% 
  ???(reps = ???, type = "permute") 
```

The output has ??? rows

****

**`calculate` the distribution of statistics from the generated data**

- Assign the output  `null_distribution_2_sample_permute`

- Display `null_distribution_2_sample_permute`
