```{r, include=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code block/chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  eval = FALSE,
  echo = TRUE,

```


1.  Load the R package we will use.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


2. Quiz questions

- Replace all the ???s. These are answers on your moodle quiz.  
* Run all the individual code chunks to make sure the answers in this file correspond with your quiz answers
* After you check all your code chunks run then you can knit it.  It won't knit until the ??? are replaced
* The quiz assumes that you have watched the videos, downloaded (to your examples folder) and worked through the exercises in [exercises_slides-1-49.Rmd](https://stanny.moodle.school/mod/resource/view.php?id=3107)

3. Pick one of your plots to save as your preview plot.  Use the `ggsave` command at the end of the chunk of the plot that you want to preview.  


# Question: modify slide 34


- Create a plot with the `faithful` dataset
- add points with `geom_point`
    - assign the variable `eruptions` to the x-axis
    - assign the variable `waiting` to the y-axis
    - colour the points according to whether `waiting` is smaller or greater than **SEE QUIZ** 


```{r}
ggplot(???) + 
   ???(aes(x = ???, y = ???, 
                  colour = ??? > ???))   
```


***

# Question: modify intro-slide 35

- Create a plot with the `faithful` dataset
- add points with `geom_point`
    - assign the variable `eruptions` to the x-axis
    - assign the variable `waiting` to the y-axis
    - assign the colour **SEE QUIZ** to all the points


```{r}
ggplot(???) + 
   ???(aes(x = ???, y = ???),
              colour = "???")   
```

***

# Question: modify intro-slide 36

- Create a plot with the `faithful` dataset
- use `geom_histogram()` to plot the distribution of `waiting` time 
    - assign the variable `waiting` to the x-axis


```{r}
ggplot(???) + 
   ???(aes(x = ???))   

```

***

# Question: modify geom-ex-1

- See how shapes and sizes of points can be specified [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html#sec:shape-spec)


- Create a plot with the `faithful` dataset
- add points with `geom_point`
    - assign the variable `eruptions` to the x-axis
    - assign the variable `waiting` to the y-axis
    - set the shape of the points to **SEE QUIZ**
    - set the point size to **SEE QUIZ**
    - set the point transparency **SEE QUIZ**


```{r}
ggplot(???) + 
   ???(aes(x = ???, y = ???), 
   shape = "???", size = ???, alpha =???)   
```

***

# Question: modify geom-ex-2

- Create a plot with the `faithful` dataset
- use `geom_histogram()` to plot the distribution of the `eruptions` (time)
- fill in the histogram based on whether eruptions are greater than or less than **3.2** minutes 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(???) + 
   ???(aes(x = ???, fill = ??? > ??? ))   
```

***

# Question: modify stat-slide-40

- Create a plot with the `mpg` dataset
- add `geom_bar()` to create a bar chart of the variable `manufacturer`

```{r}
ggplot(???) + 
   ???(aes(x = ???))   
```

***

# Question: modify stat-slide-41

- change code to count and to plot the variable `manufacturer` instead of `class`

```{r}
mpg_counted <- mpg %>% 
  count(???, name = 'count')
ggplot(mpg_counted) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = ???, y = count), stat = 'identity')

```

***

# Question: modify stat-slide-43

- change code to plot bar chart of each manufacturer as a percent of total
- change `class` to `manufacturer`

```{r}
???(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = ???, y = ???(100 * count / sum(count))))

```


***

# Question: modify answer to stat-ex-2

- For reference see [examples](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/stat_summary.html?q=stat%20_%20summary#examples).

- Use `stat_summary()` to add a dot  **SEE QUIZ** at the `median` of each group   

- color the dot **SEE QUIZ**
- make the shape of the dot  **SEE QUIZ**
- make the dot size  **SEE QUIZ**  

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x = class, y = hwy), width = 0.2) +
  stat_???(aes(x = class, y = hwy), geom = "point", 
  fun = "???", color = "???", 
  shape = "???", size = ??? )
```
