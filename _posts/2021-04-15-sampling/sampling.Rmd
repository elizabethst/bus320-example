1.  Load the R package we will use.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive) #install before loading
```

2. Quiz questions

- Replace all the instances of 'SEE QUIZ'.  These are inputs from your moodle quiz.  
- Replace all the instances of '???'. These are answers on your moodle quiz.  
* Run all the individual code chunks to make sure the answers in this file correspond with your quiz answers
* After you check all your code chunks run then you can knit it.  It won't knit until the ??? are replaced


* The quiz assumes that you have watched the videos and worked through the examples in [Chapter 7 of ModernDive](https://moderndive.com/7-sampling.html)

# Question: 

[7.2.4 in Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/7-sampling.html#different-shovels) with different sample sizes and repetitions

* Make sure you have installed and loaded the `tidyverse` and the `moderndive` packages

* Fill in the blanks

* Put the command you use in the Rchunks in your Rmd file for this quiz. 

**Modify the code for comparing differnet sample sizes from the virtual `bowl`**

**Segment 1: sample size = SEE QUIZ**


1.a) Take SEE QUIZ samples of size of SEE QUIZ instead of 1000 replicates of size 25 from the `bowl` dataset.  Assign the output to virtual_samples_SEE QUIZ

```{r}
???  <- bowl  %>% 
rep_sample_n(size = ???, reps = ???)
```

1.b) Compute resulting SEE QUIZ replicates of proportion red

- start with virtual_samples_SEE QUIZ THEN
- group_by replicate THEN
- create variable red equal to the sum of all the red balls
- create variable prop_red equal to variable red / SEE QUIZ 
- Assign the output to virtual_prop_red_SEE QUIZ

```{r}
??? <- ??? %>% 
  group_by(???) %>% 
  ???(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  ???(prop_red = red / ???)
```

1.c) Plot distribution of virtual_prop_red_SEE QUIZ via a histogram

use labs to  

- label x axis = "Proportion of SEE QUIZ balls that were red" 
- create title = "SEE QUIZ"

```{r}
ggplot(virtual_prop_red_SEE QUIZ, aes(x = ???)) +
  ???(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "???", title = "???") 
```

****

**Segment 2: sample size = SEE QUIZ**

2.a) Take SEE QUIZ samples of size of SEE QUIZ instead of 1000 replicates of size 50.  Assign the output to virtual_samples_SEE QUIZ

```{r}
???  <- bowl  %>% 
rep_sample_n(size = ???, reps = ???)
```

2.b) Compute resulting SEE QUIZ replicates of proportion red

- start with virtual_samples_SEE QUIZ THEN
- group_by replicate THEN
- create variable red equal to the sum of all the red balls
- create variable prop_red equal to variable red / SEE QUIZ 
- Assign the output to virtual_prop_red_SEE QUIZ


```{r}
??? <- ??? %>% 
  group_by(???) %>% 
  ???(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  ???(prop_red = red / ???)
```

2.c) Plot distribution of virtual_prop_red_SEE QUIZ via a histogram

use labs to  

- label x axis = "Proportion of SEE QUIZ balls that were red" 
- create title = "SEE QUIZ"

```{r}
ggplot(virtual_prop_red_SEE QUIZ, aes(x = ???)) +
  ???(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "???", title = "???") 
```

**Segment 3: sample size = SEE QUIZ**

3.a) Take SEE QUIZ samples of size of SEE QUIZ instead of 1000 replicates of size 50.  Assign the output to virtual_samples_SEE QUIZ

```{r}
???  <- bowl  %>% 
rep_sample_n(size = ???, reps = ???)
```

3.b) Compute resulting SEE QUIZ replicates of proportion red

- start with virtual_samples_SEE QUIZ THEN
- group_by replicate THEN
- create variable red equal to the sum of all the red balls
- create variable prop_red equal to variable red / SEE QUIZ 
- Assign the output to virtual_prop_red_SEE QUIZ

```{r}
??? <- ??? %>% 
  group_by(???) %>% 
  ???(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  ???(prop_red = red / ???)
```

3.c) Plot distribution of virtual_prop_red_SEE QUIZ via a histogram

use labs to  

- label x axis = "Proportion of SEE QUIZ balls that were red" 
- create title = "SEE QUIZ"

```{r}
ggplot(virtual_prop_red_SEE QUIZ, aes(x = ???)) +
  ???(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "???", title = "???") 
```

****

Calculate the standard deviations for your three sets of SEE QUIZ values of `prop_red` using the `standard deviation`

**n = SEE QUIZ**

```{r}
???  %>% 
  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red))
```

**n = SEE QUIZ**

```{r}
???  %>% 
  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red))
```

**n = SEE QUIZ**

```{r}
???  %>% 
  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red))
```

The distribution with sample size, n =  ???, has the smallest standard deviation (spread) around the estimated proportion of red balls.
